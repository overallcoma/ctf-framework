Command Execution Vulnerability in the form of a "ping checker" website.

Several commands that could be used to extract text from a file have been replaced with C++ coded apps that
print ASCII art to the screen instead of their normal operation.

SUGGESTION:
Input the flag in reverse as "rev" is an acceptable way to extract the flag.

TO LAUNCH:
python3 advancedweb-02.py -f "YourFlagHere"
